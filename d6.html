<p>Sikhism is a monotheistic religion that originated in the Punjab region of India in the late 15th century, founded by Guru Nanak Dev Ji. It emphasizes the belief in one God, who is formless, eternal, and beyond human comprehension. The core teachings of Sikhism include devotion to God, equality of all people, service to humanity, and the pursuit of justice. Sikhs believe in living a life of honesty, humility, and compassion, while also focusing on spiritual development through prayer and meditation.

  The Sikh faith is guided by the teachings of ten Gurus, starting with Guru Nanak and ending with Guru Gobind Singh. The Guru Granth Sahib, a sacred scripture composed of hymns and writings by the Gurus and other saints, is the central religious text in Sikhism. Sikhs consider the Guru Granth Sahib as their eternal Guru after the tenth Guru, Guru Gobind Singh, passed away. The scriptures offer spiritual guidance, ethics, and a way to connect with God.
  
  Sikhism also emphasizes the importance of community service, known as "seva," and the concept of "langar," which refers to free community kitchens that serve meals to anyone, regardless of background or status. This practice reflects the Sikh commitment to equality, hospitality, and selflessness. Sikhs are encouraged to contribute to society, work honestly, and live with integrity.</p>
